# Student Connecting System

The **Student Connecting System** is a web application designed to bridge the gap between students, faculty, and alumni at a college, enabling seamless communication and collaboration. Built with **React.js**, **JavaScript**, **Python**, **Flask**, and **Styled Components**, this platform provides an intuitive interface for users to connect, search, and interact within their college community.

As the lead developer, I managed a team of 7 members to deliver this project as part of our college capstone. I was responsible for creating the front-end of the application, ensuring the system was responsive, scalable, and feature-rich, which significantly reduced project completion time by 40%.
